# Cross Platform Recommendations
This python script starts with a subreddit.  It scrapes the text data from that subreddit using the reddit API for python.  Then is does some analysis with the text using NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit).  Finally, it does a search on youtube to recommend videos.  This runs in python 3.5.
